# 🦙 Alpaga

Alpaga is a local UX for Ollama. The goal is to provide a clean interface, conversation history, and real‑time listing of your locally available Ollama models.

2. Click the arrow in the top‑left corner to open the navigation sidebar.
3. Look at the bottom‑left corner to see if any models are already installed on your computer.
4. If no models are listed, click the Ollama logo at the top of the sidebar, wait a few seconds, and pull a model.
5. Once a model is installed, open a new conversation and start chatting.
